# crypto-Secure-email-exchange-encryption-decryption with Serpent in ECB mode-DHEC-RSA-signature
IN our project we describe how we do encryption for a massage when we send it and decryption when we receive it , with serpent in ECB mode , we use the ECDH for secrut key , and RSA signature , we can see a descrbtion for all this function in power point .
