# crypto-Secure-email-exchange-encryption-decryption-with-Serpent-in-ECB-mode-DHEC-RSA-signature-
IN our project we describe how we do encryption for a massage when we send it and decryption when we receive it , with serpent in ECB mode , we use the ECDH for secrut key , and RSA signature , we can see a descrbtion for all this function in power point .



# Prepare before Running 
Now i want to guide you how to download this project , you have to download the files , i work with python3.8 also anaconda prompt to download some Libraries. To download the libraries , you must have to write in anaconda prompt,exe:(pip install numpy) if you don't have a pip go to cmd and download it from there.

# How to run the code 
It's easy to run this code after you uploade the code to python you must have to click on run , and input the message that you want to encrypt , after that you can see all the steps how it work .finally , you will get he same message afeter the decrypt.
